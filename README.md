# My academia code

In 2017 I decided (for pure passion) to take some hard core Computer Architecture software engineering courses at Harvard.'

VPC is a compiler, an emulator, assembler and FPGA code (VHDL) of a computer from scratch that produces the product of two numbers.

Operational Manual of VPC here:

Final Project (video) of the course is here:

The old syllabus of the CSCIE287 was (here)[http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~cscie287/fall2017/index.html] but they have removed it.
The most recent syllabus of this class - now called CSCIE93 - is (here)[https://cscie93.dce.harvard.edu/spring2020/index.html].

(*) King Vulture on this README is from (O'Reilly SpamAssassin Book)[https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/spamassassin/0596007078/] - this project has nothing to do with Spam, but I am big fan of Vultures and I took the liberty to use its art.
