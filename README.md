# My academia code

In 2017 I decided (for pure passion) to take some hard core Computer Architecture software engineering courses at Harvard.'

VPC is a compiler, an emulator, assembler and FPGA code (VHDL) of a computer from scratch that produces the product of two numbers.

Operational Manual of VPC here:

Final Project (video) of the course is here:
